# ReactNativeMap

Runing on android device or emulator:
Once intalled the dependencies you havo to go to the folder proyect and run (you must have connected your android phone or open your 
emulator AVD)

How it works?
- Prees on map an you'll go to other screen, in this screen you have to write a name for the marker and a type of hospital. Then you have to 
press on "Guardar marcador" button. Then you could see the marker on the map (The initial region is in my natal city Bogot√° Colombia)
- This app send the selected coords to a api and then the app reads the api posts
- There are 4 buttons on the map screen when you press some of these you can see in the map the hospitals that have te info button type
